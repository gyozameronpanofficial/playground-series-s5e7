    "This notebook provides a complete baseline solution using the XGBoost algorithm to classify individuals as Introverts or Extroverts based on personality and social behavior features. It is designed for the July 2025 Kaggle Playground Series competition, where the objective is to predict the Personality target variable with maximum accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow begins by importing necessary Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and XGBoost. Then, it loads the provided training, test, and sample submission CSV files from the competition’s dataset directory. The Personality column in the training data, which contains string labels (Introvert, Extrovert), is encoded into numerical format using LabelEncoder to make it suitable for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure consistent preprocessing, the training and test feature sets are concatenated. All categorical columns are identified and encoded using OrdinalEncoder, which assigns integer values to string categories. After encoding, the data is split back into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is built using XGBoost with a basic set of hyperparameters. These include a maximum tree depth of 4 and a learning rate (eta) of 0.1. Stratified 5-fold cross-validation is used to ensure robust evaluation while preserving the class distribution. In each fold, the model is trained on a portion of the data and validated on a held-out set, and early stopping is applied to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, the notebook calculates the cross-validation accuracy based on the out-of-fold predictions. It then averages the predictions made on the test set across all folds. These final predictions are thresholded, converted back to the original string labels using the earlier label encoder, and inserted into the submission template.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the notebook writes the predictions to a submission.csv file, which is ready to be uploaded to Kaggle for evaluation. This solution serves as a clean and efficient starting point. It can be improved further with feature engineering, more advanced models, or ensemble methods."
